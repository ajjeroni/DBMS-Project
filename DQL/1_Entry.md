# Using DQL

After successfully testing our schemas by inserting rows using DML, we can move on to the next step: using **DQL (Data Query Language)** to query the project requirements listed below.

## Project Query Requirements

### For Professors
a. Given the social security number of a professor, list the titles, classrooms, meeting days, and times of the classes they teach.  
b. Given a course number and section number, count how many students received each distinct grade (e.g., ‘A’, ‘A-’, ‘B+’, ‘B’, ‘B-’, etc.).

### For Students
a. Given a course number, list all sections of that course, including the classrooms, meeting days and times, and the number of students enrolled in each section.  
b. Given a student's campus-wide ID, list all courses the student has taken along with their grades.

## Relational Algebra

Before writing SQL, we analyze each requirement by expressing the query in **relational algebra** to fully understand the operations involved.

## SQL Query

Once the relational algebra expressions are defined, we translate them into the corresponding **SQL queries** using DQL.
